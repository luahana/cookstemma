# Documentation Moved

All documentation has been moved to the root-level `docs/ai/` directory to support full-stack development.

## New Location

## Rationale

Since Pairing Planet is a **tightly-coupled full-stack application** where most features span both frontend and backend, maintaining a single source of truth for documentation ensures:

- ✅ No duplicate or conflicting information
- ✅ Easier to track changes across the stack
- ✅ Better context for AI development sessions
- ✅ Simpler maintenance
